used mathematical rules and proportions in the design, following the ideas from Vitruvius about harmony and balance.
This careful attention to shapes not only highlights the Renaissance interest in math beauty
but also lifts the facade from just being a structure to a symbol of great architectural skill.

## 4.3 Structural Composition

### 4.3.1 Rows of Columns

The use of classical rows of columns, especially the Corinthian columns that support the triangle-shaped top,
creates a clear order and makes the facade look impressively large. The columns,
with their ridged shafts and acanthus leaf tops, add to the overall height of the design,
recalling the proportions seen in old Roman temples[@PrinciplesApplications].
This classical style, smoothly blended into the facade, represents a reconnection
with the greatness of ancient times and the pursuit of excellent architecture.

### 4.3.2 Triangle Top and Horizontal Structure

The triangle-shaped top at the top of the facade stands out,
reaching upward like a pointy peak. The flat part below it,
decorated with sculpted reliefs, supports the story told by the facade.
The triangle top, a classic feature, brings a feeling of completeness and balance,
matching Alberti's focus on architectural harmony inspired by classical examples.

# 5 Expression of Alberti's Design Philosophy in Santa Maria Novella Facade

Leon Battista Alberti, a brilliant figure of the Renaissance,
made a lasting impact on how we think about and build structures.
His ideas on design, explained in writings like "De re aedificatoria",
come to life in the Santa Maria Novella Facade. This part explores
how Alberti's theories and the actual design of the facade work together in a detailed way.

## 5.1 Humanistic Proportions and Harmony

Alberti's commitment to humanistic ideals is prominently evident in the proportions and harmony
of the Santa Maria Novella Facade. In "De re aedificatoria",  Alberti emphasizes the use of harmonic proportions derived
from the human body, suggesting that a well-designed building should mirror the balanced proportions found in nature.

He explain the harmony of proportion could be achieved in such a manner “nothing could be added,
diminished or altered expect for the worse”. It simply means that one should go for perfection in the system
of proportion; one should explore many options before finalizing the best one.
He created a system of architecture based on the ratios 2:1 and 3:1 suggested by the
Timaeus of Plato in ancient Greece and based on musical scale. He reasoned that “what
is pleasing to the ear should be pleasing to the eye.” He has applied the system of
proportion for designing of the two buildings namely Santa Maria Novella
in Florence and San Sebastiani in Mantua, Italy[@PrinciplesApplications].

The facade, with its carefully orchestrated arrangement of pilasters, columns, and decorative elements,
becomes a testament to Alberti's belief in the intrinsic beauty of proportional relationships.

### 5.1.1 Vitruvian Influence

Alberti's reliance on Vitruvius as a foundational text is discernible in the facade's adherence
to the classical orders. Vitruvius' emphasis on the three qualities of firmitas (strength),
utilitas (functionality), and venustas (beauty) finds resonance in Alberti's meticulous attention to structural integrity,
functional utility, and aesthetic pleasure.

Theory of venustas is very complicated and as per these principles timeless notion
of beauty could be learnt from “truth of nature”,
nature’s designs are based on universal laws of proportion and symmetry.
He has believed that human body’s proportions are perfect created
by nature and these could be used by an architect for designing of building[@PrinciplesApplications].

The facade, therefore, becomes a harmonious composition that embodies
the Vitruvian triad, showcasing Alberti's commitment to the enduring principles of ancient architecture.

## 5.2 Classical Vocabulary and Symbols

### 5.2.1 Columns and Wall Decorations

Using a lot of classical columns, especially the Corinthian kind, gives the facade a feeling
of importance and classic beauty. Alberti didn't just pick these styles because they look nice,
it was a careful choice to remind people of the greatness of ancient Rome and Greece.
The columns, with their slim parts and fancy tops, act like strong points that add to the up-and-down pattern of the facade.

### 5.2.2 Triangle Top with Special Meaning

Alberti's love for symbols is shown in the triangle-shaped top that finishes the facade.
This triangle, a classic feature from old temple designs, represents a balanced finish to the whole structure.
The top part, pointing upward, makes people look higher and suggests a connection between what's on earth and what's divine.

## 5.3 Mathematical Precision and Rational Beauty

### 5.3.1 Application of Mathematical Ratios

Alberti, being good at math and thinking math is important,
shows this in the facade's exact shapes. The careful arrangement of building parts,
like how far apart pilasters are and the size of the main entrance,
follows Alberti's idea that architecture should follow strict math rules.
The facade becomes an example of well-organized beauty, where math order and pleasing looks come together.

### 5.3.2 Blending Good Looks and Useful Design

Alberti's focus on making things both beautiful and useful is seen in the Santa Maria Novella Facade.
The facade looks nice as a composition, but it also does its job as the entrance to the church.
Bringing together beauty and usefulness fits with Alberti's way of thinking, where architecture isn't just
about structure but is also a way to express culture and make human experiences better.

## 5.4 Blend of Arts and Sciences

Alberti's idea that architecture should mix arts and sciences is clearly shown in the Santa Maria Novella Facade.
Architects, sculptors, and craftsmen working together match Alberti's view that making buildings involves
many different skills. The sculptures, decorations, and building features all come together
to create a united whole, representing the Renaissance idea of combining different arts into one integrated approach.

## 5.5 Conclusion

To sum up, the Santa Maria Novella Facade is a real example of Leon Battista Alberti's way of designing things.
