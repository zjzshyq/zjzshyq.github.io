**Abstract:** Startup recommendation for new users without 
any behavior data is always a challenge for the recommendation system. 
We can use several advanced algorithms or strategies to deal with 
the startup in real production. However, in this course, we do not 
have so many tools in the box we discussed in class. Using the k-means 
to cluster old users to get centers, and getting the center with a 
minimum distance from the new user is the feasible solution to 
fulfill our final course task. The clustering center from k-means
delivers the new user recommend list which produced by Apriori. 
PCA reduces the dimensions of user features and assists to
determine the number of k in k-means. 

**Key Words:** K-means, PCA, Apriori, Recommendation System
