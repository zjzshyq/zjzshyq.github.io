## 1 Title
Exploring User Preferences in the Online Art Market:
A Comparative Analysis of Human-Created and AI-Generated Artwork on pixiv.net

## 2 Background
Generative AI models have revolutionized various industries, including the labor market,
with their transformative capabilities[@EconomicsChatGPT].
However, the influence of AI-generated artwork on user preferences
within the online art community remains a topic of significant interest.
As the prevalence of AI drawing tools, such as Stable-Diffusion (SD) and Midjourney,
continues to grow, it becomes crucial to investigate the different topics of AI-generated
images and understand user preferences in comparison to human-created artwork.

## 3 Literature Review
A. Zarifhonarvar's study examines how ChatGPT affects the labor market[@EconomicsChatGPT].
Econometric techniques still make a significant contribution to analyzing the cryptocurrencies
market in the AI theme[@AIThemedCryptocurrencies].
P. Fortuna and A. Modli≈Ñski discovered a phenomenon:
humans perceive the value of paintings made by AI as lower than the value of those made
by humans when the creator of the work is known[@AirtistOrCounterfeiter].
Following their research, we will continue to explore user preferences in the online art market.

## 4 Objectives
We aim to explore the factors/variables influencing the ranking of these images
and examine the preferences of ordinary users towards AI-generated versus Human-Created artwork
using an ordered choice model.
Discovering distinct themes in AI-generated and Human-created artworks
using topic modeling can also be a future main objective, but not in the paper for our course.

## 5 Dataset
In this study, we developed a web spider to crawl the dataset from [pixiv.net](http://pixiv.net),
a prominent online platform where artists share their artwork.
The website pixiv.net is widely recognized and highly regarded within the online art community,
making it an ideal source for collecting data related to AI-generated artwork and user preferences.

We collected the data spanning from October 31, 2022, to May 15,
2023 from the top list of AI-generated and human-created image pages.
After de-duplicating same image pages which may appear in top with different ranks and different days,
we gathered the samples:

- Number of all samples: 14576
- Number of samples of AI-generated Artworks: 8092
- Number of samples of Hand-drawn or human-created Artworks: 6484

## 6 Methodology
### 6.1 Econometrics Toolds
For analyzing the daily rank of pictures as ordered data,
we will employ econometrics tools which are ordered choice models.
Specifically, we will utilize both the ordered logit and ordered probit methods
to examine the relationships between the independent variables and the categorized rankings effectively.

### 6.2 Machine Learning Algorithms
For differing the topics in ranked pages, we will apply some neural network/deep learning algorithms
to finish the job in the future work.

## 7 Significance of the Study
This study can provides in-depth insights into the digitization trends in the contemporary painting art market.
and explores the role of artificial intelligence in artistic creation,
offering not only references for the future development of digital art,
but also a new and profitable perspective on potential user preferences in the future art market.

## 8 Expected Results
The accomplishment of this paper can determine whether art generated by artificial intelligence,
especially AI painting, is subject to cognitive biases due to technological characteristics.
We can also identify the preferences of the general ACG (Animation Comic and Game) users
for AI-generated painting works and reveal the potential changes of digital technology
on the online art market through this research.
