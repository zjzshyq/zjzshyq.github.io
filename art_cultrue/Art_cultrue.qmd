### 2.2 AI versus humans

#### 2.2.1 Artistic Reflection on Artificial Intelligence Digital Painting

The article "Artistic Reflection on Artificial Intelligence Digital Painting”[@ArtisticReflection]  by Xinlu Liu delves into the evolving intersection between artificial intelligence (AI) and traditional painting. The paper posits that while AI technology has revolutionized many fields, including art, it inherently lacks the diversity and humanization found in traditional painting techniques. This limitation arises from AI's mechanical nature, which restricts its choice of painting materials and the setting of brush parameters, thereby impacting the expressiveness and emotional depth of the resulting artworks.

Liu argues that despite these limitations, the continuous advancement of technology will inevitably enrich the artistic content of AI-generated works over time, contributing to their eventual acceptance and appreciation within the art community. The paper underscores the importance of integrating AI with traditional painting to foster innovation in art creation and ensure the sustainable development of both technology and humanities.

The article outlines several key points:

- **Integration of AI in Art**: AI provides new possibilities for artistic creation, leading to innovations in form and diversification in the development of new media art.

- **Comparison with Traditional Painting**: Traditional painting possesses a unique creative mode and artistic concept that AI has yet to fully replicate, particularly in terms of material media and expressive styles.

- **Interrelation and Differences**: While AI and traditional painting share some theoretical foundations, significant differences remain in their expressive capabilities and impact on the viewer.

- **Influence on Creation**: The incorporation of AI in art has not only altered materials and tools but has also transformed artists' creative processes and conceptual approaches.

- **Future Directions**: The paper advocates for a balanced integration of AI technologies and traditional art forms, emphasizing the need for continuous theoretical research and industry regulation to foster the healthy development of AI in art.

Liu suggests that while AI technology can significantly enhance artistic creativity and introduce new forms of expression, the essence and depth of traditional art should not be overlooked. The fusion of AI with traditional painting practices offers a promising avenue for the evolution of art, provided it is navigated with a thoughtful appreciation of both mediums' unique strengths. However, Liu's research did not point out users' different attitudes toward AI-generated and human-created artwork, let alone analyze user preferences based on this.

#### 2.2.2 From Pigments to Pixels: A Comparison of Human and AI Painting

In the exploration of the intersection between art and artificial intelligence (AI), "From Pigments to Pixels: A Comparison of Human and AI Painting”[@Pigments2Pixels] embarks on a nuanced analysis of AI's role in the creative process of painting. The overarching purpose of this research is not merely to assess AI's ability to mimic human art indistinguishably but to understand its potential to generate art that is rich in cultural significance and capable of eliciting emotional responses from viewers.

The comprehensive methodology was adopted to scrutinize the distinctions and perceptions surrounding AI and human-generated artworks, focusing on the theme of 'Home Sweet Home.' The research utilized six paintings each from an amateur artist, Sandy Lee, and AI algorithms, specifically employing the Whitening and Coloring Transforms (WCT), Gatys, and Structure-emphasized Multimodal Style Transfer (SEMST) for style conversion. The chosen artworks represented varied interpretations of 'home,' selected by art history and aesthetics experts to ensure thematic consistency and richness.

The study engaged 380 participants, with a significant portion (70%) having prior painting experience, to compare and contrast the two sets of artworks across multiple dimensions. This diverse participant pool was pivotal for examining the nuanced perceptions and emotional resonances elicited by each set of paintings, aiming to illuminate the aesthetic and emotional differentials between human and AI artistry. Its design was methodically structured to evaluate the artworks on technical, semantic, and effectual levels, incorporating a multifaceted approach to understanding art appreciation. This included assessing elements such as color, brushstroke, and line for their technical execution; emotional impact for semantic analysis; and overall affective response for understanding the artworks' effect level. Furthermore, the study meticulously controlled for potential biases by ensuring anonymity in the presentation of the artworks and utilized online platforms for dissemination and feedback collection, adjusting for the digital medium's influence on artistic perception.

The results of this study present a detailed analysis of the participant's ability to differentiate between AI and human paintings, the emotional impact of AI paintings, and areas where AI still lags behind human creativity. A significant finding is that a large proportion of participants mistook AI paintings for human-made works, indicating the AI's capability to mimic human artistic expression closely. However, when analyzing the emotional impact of AI paintings, specific technical aspects like color brightness, line precision, and fluency were identified as significant predictors of the affective response to the theme of "Home Sweet Home," suggesting that while AI can replicate styles, it struggles to evoke the deeper emotional responses associated with human creativity.

Furthermore, the study highlights the creative limitations of AI in art, noting that AI lacks the capacity for self-awareness and holistic perspective, crucial for the depth and emotional resonance typically found in human art. This limitation was particularly evident in cases where the AI's representation of themes diverged from human expectations, leading to a lesser emotional impact and appreciation by the viewers.

A significant aspect shows AI's inability to draw upon real-life memories and emotional associations, a cornerstone in human artistic expression. This limitation becomes evident in AI's handling of color symbolism and emotional conveyance, where AI struggles to emulate the nuanced associations humans naturally integrate into their artworks. The discussion further critiques AI's inability to grasp the social significance of colors, a vital element in the rich tapestry of human art that goes beyond mere aesthetics to embody cultural and emotional depth.

Moreover, the study explores the idea that, unlike human artists who can reflect on the overall composition, considering emotional impact, symbolic meaning, and aesthetic balance, AI lacks this reflective capacity. This is because AI approaches art creation from a purely technical standpoint, devoid of the emotional and cognitive processes that guide human creativity. Consequently, while AI can mimic specific styles and techniques, it falls short of capturing the essence and depth of human artistic expression, which is deeply rooted in personal experience, cultural context, and emotional intelligence.

The study recommends two primary avenues for further exploration:

- **Gallery-based Art Viewing for Comparative Studies**: Highlighting the difference in perception between viewing art in person versus online, the study suggests future research should incorporate live gallery viewings. Such settings can offer richer, more nuanced insights into the viewer's engagement with art, potentially unveiling aspects that digital viewings might obscure.

- **Semantic Recognition to Augment AI Creativity**: To bridge the gap in AI's understanding of artistry's semantic layers, the study proposes integrating advanced semantic recognition technologies. This could enable AI to autonomously select and interpret artworks for style transfer, thereby enhancing its learning process and creative outputs.

The juxtaposition of human and AI artistry in this study illuminates the profound gap between technical mimicry and genuine artistic expression. While AI can replicate styles and techniques, it lacks the intrinsic human capacity to imbue art with emotional depth and societal context. As AI continues to evolve, its potential to parallel human creativity remains an open question, inviting further exploration and technological advancements.

#### 2.2.3 A(I)rtist or Counterfeiter? Artificial Intelligence as (D)Evaluating Factor on the Art Market

This paper, A(I)rtist or Counterfeiter? Artificial Intelligence as (D)Evaluating Factor on the Art Market[@AirtistOrCounterfeiter], explores the impact of Artificial Intelligence AI on the perception and valuation of art by audiences. The central finding is that people value paintings less when they learn these were created by AI, regardless of the painting's style or actual market value. This indicates a heuristic difference in assessing AI-made art, viewing AI not as an equal to human artists. The study suggests significant implications for art management, highlighting potential challenges in selling AI-created paintings and the contextual influence on valuation when AI and human-made art are displayed together. The research hypothesizes that the lower perceived value of AI art is mediated by perceived artistry and overall impression and that AI-made art is excluded from the category of human art, affecting the valuation of figurative versus abstract paintings differently depending on the artist's identity (AI or human). The conclusion reinforces that authorship by AI negatively affects art's perceived value, suggesting human-made art is seen as superior, impacting both impression and pricing in the art market.

The design of the research outlines a comprehensive experimental framework to investigate how the knowledge that a painting is created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) impacts its perceived value compared to those known to be created by humans. The experiment utilized a 2x2x2 factorial design to explore variations in perceived value based on the painting's authorship (AI vs. human), contextual information (value of similar artworks by AI vs. humans), and style (figurative vs. abstract). The study engaged 296 participants, randomly assigned to one of eight groups, to assess the value of paintings produced by AI algorithms. The paintings were either in the style of Paul Cezanne’s “Houses at the L’Estaque” re-interpreted by CloudPainter or an abstract still-life by Ai-Da. A unique aspect of the experimental design was the introduction of a fictional artist, "Iog Wasamaru," to uniformly represent authorship across conditions. Contextual cues were manipulated by informing participants of the price of similar artworks by either humans or AI, exploring the impact of these cues on valuation. The study measured perceived value through participants' price estimations, alongside assessments of the artwork's artistry and overall impression. This design aimed to elucidate not only the direct effect of authorship on perceived value but also the mediating role of perceived artistry and overall impression, thereby providing insights into the heuristic processes underlying the valuation of art in the context of AI authorship.

Several results were from the experiments.

- **Authorship Effect**: The author of the painting (AI vs. human) had a notable impact on its perceived value. Paintings identified as created by humans were valued higher than those attributed to AI, supporting the hypothesis that AI authorship diminishes perceived value.

- **Contextual Influence**: The context in which a painting's value is considered (whether compared to AI or human-created art) also significantly affects its perceived worth. Paintings were valued more when the contextual cue was the price of similar images painted by AI than by humans. This finding suggests that the knowledge of AI authorship, when used as a contextual cue, influences the valuation process. **Independency from Painting Style

- *Independency from Painting Style*: No significant differences were observed regarding the painting's style (figurative vs. abstract) on its perceived value, indicating that the style does not influence the valuation as authorship and contextual cues do.

- **Mediation Analysis**: Further analysis, explored how the negative impact of AI authorship on a painting's perceived value is mediated by the author's perceived artistry and the overall impression the art piece makes on the viewers. Both factors partially mediated the relationship, but the direct effect of authorship on perceived value remained stronger.

These findings elucidate the significant role of authorship and contextual cues in the valuation of art, emphasizing that paintings by human artists are perceived as more valuable than those by AI, regardless of the art's style. The study highlights the nuanced ways in which information about a painting's origin and the contextual valuation cues influence public perception and valuation of art in the AI era.

The authors assert that people do not regard AI as equivalent to human artists in the realm of art creation, highlighting a general tendency to value human-created art more highly. This perception suggests a broader human inclination to reserve certain domains, such as creativity, exclusively for human endeavor, aligning with previous sociological and anthropological research. The discussion further explores how contextual information influences art valuation. Paintings associated with AI-generated art context cues are perceived as more valuable, indicating a bias towards human artistry over machine creation. This phenomenon is linked to societal narratives that often cast robots and AI as threats to human uniqueness and competence, reinforcing a desire to maintain a distinct human domain in creative endeavors.

The authors also touch on the concept of reactance, suggesting that the devaluation of AI art might reflect a form of resistance against the encroachment of machines into traditionally human territories. Moreover, the direct and indirect impacts of the art's authorship on its perceived value are examined, with a notable emphasis on the overwhelming importance of knowing the artist's identity (human or AI) in determining a painting's worth.

For recommendations for art management and marketing professionals, the paper advises them to be mindful of how art created by AI is presented alongside human-created art. The juxtaposition of these works could negatively influence the valuation of both, given the prevailing biases and perceptions. The paper emphasizes the need for strategic communication and presentation in the art market to navigate the complexities introduced by AI-created art. However, it focuses more on perception and valuation differences rather than user preferences and the detailed comparison between AI and human art on platforms like Pixiv.net, indicating a potential area for further exploration in my work.

### 2.3 How users feel about generative AI
#### 2.3.1 Everyone is an Artist? A study on user experience of AI-based painting system

The paper, Everyone is an artist? A study on user experience of AI-based painting system[@EveryoneArtist], explores the integration of AI in the realm of painting, highlighting recent advances in AI-based Painting Systems (AIBPS). It delves into the technology acceptance model (TAM) to understand and predict users' acceptance of AI technologies. It outlines a comprehensive model that includes external variables such as previous experience (PE), technical features (TF), hedonic motivation (HM), and perceived trust (PT), alongside core TAM variables like perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU), to investigate their impact on users' attitudes towards using AIBPS and their behavioral intention.

The discussion starts with an overview of AI in painting, noting that modern AIBPS leverages semantic analysis and deep learning algorithms to create new images from textual input. It mentions significant achievements, like the sale of the AI-generated portrait "Edmond de Belamy" and the variety of emerging neural network-based generative models. By discussing the TAM framework, the paper emphasizes its importance in evaluating new technology's acceptance by measuring PU and PEOU, and how it has evolved to include additional external variables that influence these core perceptions.  Research hypotheses are then developed to test the relationships between the external variables (PE, TF, HM, PT) and the core TAM constructs (PU, PEOU, ATT, BI). These hypotheses suggest that users' previous experiences with AIBPS, the system's technical features, users' hedonic motivation, and their perceived trust in AIBPS will positively influence their perceived usefulness and ease of use of these systems, which in turn would affect their attitude towards using AIBPS and their behavioral intention to use it. The hypotheses aim to unravel the complexities of user acceptance of AIBPS, highlighting the role of both the intrinsic technology attributes and the users' psychological motivations. This investigation is positioned as a significant contribution to the literature, offering insights for system developers and enterprises on how to enhance user engagement and promote the sustainable development of AI technologies in art and beyond.

The methods used in this paper outline the systematic approach undertaken by the authors to collect and analyze data for their study which is divided into three main parts: questionnaire design, participants and data collection, and demographic information of the participants.

The questionnaire was meticulously designed in three sections, starting with a brief introduction to AI painting and relevant images to provide context. The second part focused on gathering demographic information such as gender, age, educational background, frequency of use, and experience level with AIBPS. The main section aimed at understanding users' willingness to utilize AIBPS, comprising 34 items across 8 variables to capture a wide range of attitudes and perceptions towards AIBPS. To ensure the questionnaire's clarity and relevance, it underwent validation by five expert university professors with significant experience in teaching AI and art. Participants were incentivized with a small financial reward for their participation.

Data was collected online via a popular Chinese questionnaire platform, resulting in 568 responses. After a rigorous screening process that included removing invalid responses and controlling for typical technique bias, 528 valid questionnaires remained for analysis. This large sample size is deemed sufficient for Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis, adhering to the requirement of a sample size greater than 200.

The demographic analysis of participants revealed a balanced gender distribution and a predominance of younger respondents, with a significant portion being undergraduates or holding higher educational qualifications. Most participants reported frequent use of AIBPS and had previous painting experience. Additionally, familiarity with different AI painting systems was also assessed, showing a high degree of awareness and usage among the participants.

The study on AI-Based Painting Systems (AIBPS) presents the findings from applying Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to test the hypotheses formulated based on an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). There are 13 hypotheses tested related to the influence of previous experience (PE), technical features (TF), hedonic motivation (HM), and perceived trust (PT) on perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU). It also examined how PU, PEOU, and users' attitudes (ATT) towards AIBPS affect their behavioral intentions (BI) to use the systems.

The results supported most of the hypotheses. Specifically, hedonic motivation (HM) and perceived trust (PT) positively influenced both PU and PEOU. This indicates that users' enjoyment and trust in AIBPS significantly impact their perceptions of the system's usefulness and ease of use. Contrary to expectations, PE and TF did not significantly impact PU, suggesting that users' previous experiences with AIBPS and the technical aspects of the systems do not significantly influence their perceived usefulness. However, PE and TF positively influenced PEOU, indicating that these factors affect users' perceptions of the ease of using AIBPS.

The SEM path analysis revealed the direct and indirect relationships among the variables. PU and PEOU had a significant positive impact on ATT and BI, confirming the core propositions of TAM that users' perceptions of usefulness and ease of use influence their attitudes towards and intentions to use technology. The models the paper used demonstrated a good fit with the data, indicated by fit indices such as CMIN/DF, NFI, IFI, TLI, CFI, GFI, and RMSEA. This suggests that the extended TAM effectively captures the factors influencing user acceptance of AIBPS.

The study provides insights for AIBPS developers and researchers by highlighting the importance of hedonic motivation(HM) and perceived trust(PT) in influencing user acceptance. It suggests that enhancing the enjoyment and trustworthiness of AIBPS could improve users' attitudes and intentions towards these systems and the usage of AI-based creative tools. Despite the positive impacts of HM and PT, previous experience (PE) and technical features (TF) did not significantly influence perceived usefulness (PU), suggesting that the interface and interaction design of AIBPS may already meet user expectations to a certain extent.

For future research, the paper acknowledges several limitations, including the regional focus on Chinese respondents, which may not capture global user perspectives. Future studies are encouraged to gather data from various countries to broaden the understanding of AIBPS acceptance. Additionally, the use of online questionnaires is noted as a potential constraint on understanding users' attitudes comprehensively, suggesting that interviews or focus groups could provide deeper insights.

#### 2.3.2 Understanding the Impact of AI Generated Content on Social Media: The Pixiv Case

The paper, Understanding the Impact of AI Generated Content on Social Media: The Pixiv Case[@AIGC_pixiv], aims to explore the impact of AIGC on social media ecosystems by analyzing Pixiv, which uniquely hosts both humans and AIGC. Through an extensive dataset, the research investigates differences in content creation and consumption patterns between AIGC and human-generated content, aiming to understand AIGC's influence on user engagement, community dynamics, and content themes. This inquiry is framed around three research questions focusing on the ecosystem's temporal analysis, per-creator analysis, and per-content analysis, setting the stage for a comprehensive examination of AIGC's role in reshaping social media dynamics.

In the ecosystem temporal analysis of this paper, we can draw several conclusions.

- **Impact on User Activity**: The introduction of AIGC led to a 50% increase in the number of new artworks, but this surge in content creation did not correspond with an increase in views or user comments. This suggests that while more content was being produced, it did not necessarily engage the community more than before.

- **Impact on Creators**: The arrival of AIGC coincided with a growth in the number of new creators on Pixiv. However, there was a 4.3% decrease in newly registered creators of human-generated content, indicating a potential shift in the creator base towards AI-generated works. Despite this shift, the engagement of existing creators remained stable.

- **Impact on Topics**: Topics and subjects of artworks saw significant changes, with a decrease in diversity and a higher concentration of adult content and female characters. This shift suggests that AIGC may be influencing the types of content being created and shared within the Pixiv community.

Overall, this analysis outlines how the integration of AIGC into Pixiv has led to notable shifts in content creation and consumption patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between technology and social media ecosystems.

The per-creator analysis delves into a comparative study of AI and human creators on Pixiv.net, focusing on aspects such as productivity, profile differences, and activities. We find AI creators can produce artwork more rapidly than human creators, with 55% of AI-generated artwork being uploaded on the same day as the previous one by the same creator, compared to 20% for human-generated artwork. Despite this efficiency, AI creators do not significantly upload more artworks than their human counterparts. AI creators not only show distinct demographic profiles, with a higher proportion identifying as male and working in IT-related fields than human creators but also are found to be less communicative, with a higher percentage of their artworks lacking captions compared to human-generated artworks. That leads to a noticeable trend among AI creators to use their posts for monetization more aggressively, with a higher percentage of AI-generated artworks including links to platforms like Fanbox, Patreon, and others. This analysis highlights the efficiency of AI creators in producing artworks and their distinct behavior in terms of communication and monetization, and also underscores the evolving dynamics between human and AI creators, reflecting on how AI is shaping content creation and creator interactions on the platform.

The per-content analysis investigates how consumer engagement with AIGC compares to engagement with human-created content on Pixiv.net. This analysis reveals distinct patterns in content consumption and interaction, focusing on views, bookmarks, popular themes, creators, and the nature of comments. AIGC sees different engagement levels compared to human-created content. While AI-generated works are more popular in the mid and lower popularity percentiles, they do not match the most popular human-created artworks in terms of views and bookmarks. This indicates that while AIGC plays a significant role in content consumption, it hasn't yet eclipsed top human creators. Consumption of human-created content centers around the most popular creators and themes, receiving more views and bookmarks per capita. Conversely, the popularity of AIGC is more uniformly distributed, suggesting that AI-generated artworks attract a broader base of interest, albeit with less intensity than the peaks seen in human-created content. Analysis of comments reveals a clear pattern of interaction within groups; both human and AI creators are more likely to engage with content from their respective categories. Human-created artworks receive significantly more comments on average than AI-generated ones, highlighting a community preference or a higher willingness to engage with human creators. The findings from this analysis reveal how AIGC has integrated into the broader narrative of content creation and consumption, influencing user engagement, the distribution of popularity among artworks, and the dynamics of community interaction.

The paper provides a groundbreaking large-scale empirical analysis of AIGC's impact on social media ecosystems, with a focus on Pixiv's unique features. By comparing different platforms, the authors reveal how their insights could help in developing policies and algorithms for effectively managing AIGC. This approach not only underscores the originality and relevance of their findings but also contrasts with previous studies centered on user perceptions and the effects of AIGC on content authenticity and creator acknowledgment.

Throughout the paper, an increase in the production and consumption of AI-generated artworks is documented, alongside changing creator profiles and engagement patterns. Interestingly, these shifts have not significantly affected user interaction patterns, hinting at the Pixiv community's preference for human-created content. However, the paper selectively addresses certain topics for analysis and stops short of exploring user preferences in detail, particularly in terms of how AI-generated artworks are received compared to those created by humans across varied themes. The study also expresses concerns about AIGC's potential to sideline human creators, especially those new to the field, and its tendency to focus on specific themes like game-related content, which could impact the diversity of the platform. This nuanced exploration presents a complex picture of AIGC's role in shaping online communities, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of its broader implications.
