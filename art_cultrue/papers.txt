3.1
Our primary hypothesis focuses on comparing the effects of AI-generated and man-made art on rankings within the online art community. To investigate this, we analyze various user behaviors such as liked rates, bookmarked rates, and the content indicated by artwork tags. By comparing these features between AI-generated and man-made artwork, we can gain valuable insights into the unique characteristics and influences of AI-generated creations. This analysis allows us to assess whether AI-generated art has a distinct impact on user preferences and rankings compared to traditional hand-drawn art.
3.2
we propose a secondary hypothesis that explores which user behaviors and specific content attributes contribute to higher rankings for AI-generated artwork. By examining factors such as user interactions, engagement patterns, and the content of the artwork itself, we aim to identify the elements that attract users and lead to greater popularity and preference for AI-generated art.
