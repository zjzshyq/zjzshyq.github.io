This thesis explores user preferences for AI-generated versus human-created artwork on pixiv.net, focusing on how generative AI models impact the online art market. It uses a dataset from pixiv.net, covering the period from October 31, 2022, to May 15, 2023, and employs econometric models to analyze image rankings. The study aims to understand the influence of topics derived via deep learning on user preferences and examines whether these preferences differ between AI-generated and human-created art. This could influence art production and promotion strategies or highlight the competitive relationship between these two art forms in the market. The methodology includes topic modeling with BERT and ordered choice models to investigate the relationship between image topics and rankings. The study's significance lies in its potential insights into digitization trends and the role of AI in artistic creation, offering perspectives on future user preferences in the online painting market.
